# Project For "Advanced Machine Learning Subject"

## Air Quality Prediction with LSTM
### Target:
The target of this application is to provide accurate air quality predictions, enabling individuals to minimize exposure to harmful pollutants and make informed decisions for health and environmental sustainability.

### Motivation:
Air quality directly impacts human health, environmental sustainability, and overall quality of life. With the increasing levels of urbanization, industrialization, and climate change, poor air quality has become a pressing global challenge. People are more aware than ever of the need to monitor air quality to make informed decisions that can protect their health and the environment.

An air quality prediction application addresses this need by providing accurate and timely forecasts of air pollution levels. It empowers individuals, communities, and policymakers with actionable insights. For example:

- Health Protection: Air pollution is linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other severe health conditions. A prediction system helps users plan their outdoor activities to minimize exposure during high-risk periods.
- Environmental Awareness: By understanding patterns of air pollution, individuals and communities can take steps to reduce emissions and advocate for greener policies.
- Data-Driven Decision-Making: Industries and governments can leverage predictive insights to implement proactive measures, such as traffic restrictions, emission controls, or public advisories, before pollution levels exceed safe thresholds.
- Climate Change Mitigation: Tracking air quality data over time helps in understanding trends, identifying pollution hotspots, and devising long-term strategies to mitigate environmental impacts.

### Application:
This application will allow users to view detailed charts of pollutant levels for several cities across the United States, using data sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These visualizations will help users track air quality trends, compare pollution levels across locations, and gain insights into environmental conditions.

#### Key Air Quality Indicators
Factors taken into consideration during prediction process can be seen in the table below:

| **SO₂**    | Parts per billion (ppb)            | Combustion of sulfur-rich fossil fuels (coal), oil refining, volcanic activity        | Irritates respiratory pathways, triggers asthma attacks                                                  | 75 ppb (1-hour average)                               | Major contributor to acid rain, damaging plants, soils, and water bodies |

European Air Quality Standards (for reference):
- **CO**: 10 ppm (8-hour average)  
- **NO₂**: Annual average ≤ 40 µg/m³ (~21 ppb)  
- **O₃**: Maximum 8-hour concentration ≤ 120 µg/m³ (~0.06 ppm)  
- **PM2.5**: Annual average ≤ 25 µg/m³ (WHO recommends 5 µg/m³)
